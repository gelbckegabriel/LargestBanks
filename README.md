  <h1><strong>Largest Banks Analysis - Data Engineering (ETL)</strong></h1>
  <p>The Largest Banks is a data engineering project from Coursera to test skills to complete an ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) pipeline for accessing data from a website and processing to meet requirements, the code written in here was made from me. To execute my code, you will need to install a few python packages, such as: <strong>requests, bs4, pandas, sqlite3, numpy & datetime</strong>.

  <h2>:open_file_folder: Project Scenario:</h2>
  <p>
    I have been hired as a data engineer by research organization. My boss has asked me to create a code that can be used to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in
    the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR and INR as well, in accordance with the exchange rate
    information that has been made available to me as a CSV file. The processed information table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table.
    <br><br>
    You can find the required data on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230908091635 /https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks" target="_blank">this wikipedia
      webpage</a>.
    <br>
    The exchange rate can be found on <a href="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-PY0221EN-Coursera/labs/v2/exchange_rate.csv"
